Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project is:

1. To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and
2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

The application itself solves a real business problem - quickly identify the best performing categories/items in sales dataset. It is available online under the following link: https://yuriy.shinyapps.io/Quadrant_sales_analysis/.

The reproducible pitch presentation about this application is available under: https://rpubs.com/YLisovets/741474.
